ðŸŸ¢ Step 1: Sign in to AWS Console
Go to https://aws.amazon.com.

Click "Sign in to Console" in the top right.

Use your root user or IAM user credentials to log in.

ðŸŸ¢ Step 2: Launch an EC2 Instance
In the AWS Management Console, in the search bar, type EC2 and select EC2 Dashboard.

Click Launch Instance.

Fill in the following details:
Name: UbuntuWebServer (or any name you prefer).

AMI (Operating System): Choose Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS (HVM), SSD Volume Type.

Instance Type: Select t2.micro (Free Tier eligible).

Key Pair:

If you donâ€™t have a key pair, click Create new key pair.

Name it (e.g., ubuntu-key).

Key type: Choose RSA.

Format: Select .pem.

Click Download Key Pair (save this file safely â€” you'll need it for SSH access).

Network Settings: Click Edit to configure inbound rules:

Allow SSH (port 22) from your IP (for secure access).

Allow HTTP (port 80) from Anywhere (0.0.0.0/0) (to serve web traffic).

Storage: Leave the default storage as 8 GB.

Click Launch Instance.

ðŸŸ¢ Step 3: Connect to Your Ubuntu EC2 Instance via SSH
Go to the EC2 Dashboard > Instances.

Select your instance and wait until the Instance State is Running.

Copy the Public IPv4 address (e.g., 3.123.45.67).

Open a terminal on your local machine and navigate to the folder where you saved your .pem key file.


cd /path/to/your/key
chmod 400 ubuntu-key.pem
ssh -i "ubuntu-key.pem" ubuntu@<your-public-ip>
Replace <your-public-ip> with the actual IP address you copied from the AWS Console (e.g., 3.123.45.67).

Step 4: Update and Install Apache Web Server
Once connected to your EC2 instance via SSH, run the following commands to update your packages:
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade -y
Install Apache:
sudo apt install apache2 -y
Start Apache and enable it to run on boot:
sudo systemctl start apache2
sudo systemctl enable apache2
 Step 5: Configure the Firewall (if needed)
Note: Ubuntu EC2 instances usually donâ€™t use ufw (Ubuntu Firewall) by default when running on AWS, so you may not need to do this unless explicitly required.

Ensure HTTP traffic is allowed through your Security Group in AWS:

Go to the EC2 Dashboard > Security Groups.

Find the Security Group attached to your instance.

Click Inbound Rules > Edit.

Add a new rule:

Type: HTTP

Port: 80

Source: Anywhere (0.0.0.0/0)

Click Save.

ðŸŸ¢ Step 6: Test the Web Server
Open your web browser.

Enter the public IP address of your instance in the browser:

http://<your-public-ip>
You should see the default Apache2 Ubuntu Default Page.
Step 7: (Optional) Replace the Default Web Page
To replace the default page with your own custom message, create a simple HTML file
echo "<h1>My Final Exam Web Server is Working!</h1>" | sudo tee /var/www/html/index.html
Refresh your browser, and you should now see the message "My Final Exam Web Server is Working!".
